# sqlyog-job-agent-documentation
The missing SQLYog Job Agent (SJA) documentation. Please contribute.

The SQLYog Job Agent is a nifty little tool that can synchronize multiple databases, tables and is fully configurable. It can be put in CRON commands, schedulers etc. and comes with a handy set of XML configuration files. The only problem is, that this app is not provided with any kind of documentation/manual etc. This repo is supposed to list out my findings (mostly via trial and error) and document it in one place.

Please contribute to grow this documentation.
